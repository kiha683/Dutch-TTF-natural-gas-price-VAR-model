# Dutch-TTF-natural-gas-price-VAR-model

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyze the relationship between TTF (Title Transfer Facility) price and Natural Gas price, including several factors such as temperature, STOXX600, and natural gas inventory. The project is built with Python, using libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Data

The data used in this project includes TTF price, STOXX600, temperature, natural gas price, and natural gas inventory. The data is obtained from several sources and merged into one dataset.

## Installation

The code is built in Google Colab, and the data is stored in Google Drive. To run the code, you need to install the following libraries:

    Numpy
    Pandas
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn

## Code

The code reads in the data, merges the data into one dataset, and cleans the data by removing missing values and converting the data into a time series. Then, the code generates several plots to analyze the relationship between TTF price and natural gas price, as well as other factors.

## Result

The result shows that TTF price is positively correlated with the natural gas price, as well as the temperature, STOXX600, and natural gas inventory.
